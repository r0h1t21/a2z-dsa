def method_2(n):
    '''
        If "n" is the given number and let's say sum of all the divisors for 1 to n is F(n).
        Then F(n) = floor(n / i) * i, because from high school mathematics we know that,
        in a range of 1 to n, the number of multiples of i is nothing but floor(n / i).
        For example, the number of 10 multiples in the range of 1 to 100 = floor(100 / 10) = 10,
        and those multiples are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.
